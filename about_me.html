      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>Hello again! I'm Kurtis Volker — I'm a creator driven by a passion for art, storytelling, and the spirit of love that shines through play. I'm praying that in our cluelessness we'll find a way to make this world a better place for one another. Best to be the best student, game dev, artist, and friend that I can be, even when life doesn't make sense!</p>
      <p>Born and raised in Californina, I am a Computer Science Major at Cal State Fullerton, I work as a "sound 'n slides guy" at a local church. I've 3 years of dedicated art experience, several coding languages under my belt (including C++ and HTML, but I'm most proficient in Python). When I'm not swimming in semester finals, I'm likely sketching game concepts, finding the perfect gift for a friend, coding or just playing games! I'm also a big believer in staying goofy — because life is too short to take yourself too seriously!</p>
      <p>Thanks for visiting this page! If you'd like to work together or just say hi, don't hesitate to <a href="./index.html#contact">reach out</a>!</p>
