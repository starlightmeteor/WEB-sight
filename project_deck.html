    <p style="text-align: center">A deck-building video game where two players will face off while playing different creatures and attaching attacks and items to change their abilities.

        The game is inspired around a mix of Pokemon's battle mechanics and a more traditional TCG-type board strategy. Each game is a 2v2 and each player has a total of 4 lives. Developed in Python using Pygame, project took around a month.</p>

        <p><em>A simple concept with tons of depth and strategy (working title "Deck Game": we never replaced it).</em></p>
