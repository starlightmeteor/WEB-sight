    <p style="text-align: center">A deck-building video game where two players will face off while playing different creatures and attaching attacks and items to change their abilities.

        The game is inspired around a mix of Pokemon's battle mechanics and a more traditional TCG-type board strategy. Each game is a 2v2 and each player has a total of 4 lives. Developed in Python using Pygame, project took around a month.</p>

        <p><em>A simple concept with tons of depth and strategy (working title "Deck Game": we never replaced it).</em></p>

        <p><em>There are 4 kinds of cards! Creatures must be played first, then skills, items, and effects can be played to them in any of their 3 slots.</em></p>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>Development with a teammate was interesting! My partner Emily primarily handled the back end of the project, creating lists and dictionaries to store hand objects, generating the player and their deck related attribles. I implemented all of the visuals, card effects, game loops, buttons, and Pygame code. There were a few big hurdles to climb before actually getting the cards to show on the screen and be able to be manipulated by the player to enter into slots! Once that was accomplished, each new feature took around 3 days to implement. First it was adding the Phase Structure and the legality of cardplay, then it was implementing health, skills, and damage calculation for creatures! Discarding cards was one of the biggest challenges, since I had to be able to identify from a skill exactly where the responsible creature was, what effects in use, and how to safely remove the card from play without disrupting the game loop! All and all, my favorite project so far and one I will certainly come back to!</p>
